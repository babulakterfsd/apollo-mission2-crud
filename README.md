# CRUD using typescript, mongoose and express js.

- In this project, I will follow modular pattern, not mvc pattern. cause, in mvc pattern, if we need to change a single thing, we have to touch all the relevant model, schema, controller, etc in different folders. but in modular pattern, we can change relevant things in a single folder, cause in modular pattern , all the files for a single type of collection are kept in same folder (modular way). so, it's easy to maintain. different devs can work on different folders without touching other folders.

- interface -> schema -> model -> db query -> response
